                    <p>In July of 2016 my family went to Malaysia to sightsee
                       and to visit my wife's side of the family. It was our first trip as a family to
                       Malaysia. Here are my daughters Maya and Sofia enjoy a quick motorbike
                       ride with their grandfather.

                    <p>Not long after we arrived in Malaysia we took a short plane ride to
                       Langkawi on a trip within a trip.

                    <p>In Langkawi one of the place's we visted was Mahsuri's grave site. Mahsuri
                       was a woman who live in Langkawi near the end of the 18th century. As the legend goes,
                       while her husband was away at war, jealous women in the village accused her of
                       adultery. She was found guilty and executed with her families keras(a dagger of sorts). While
                       she lay dying, it was told that instead of blood white liquid flowed from her wound,
                       signifying her innocence. While she lay dying she cursed Langkawi for seven generations for what they had done. It
                       wasn't until after this time had passed, did Langkawi prosper as a tourist destination.

                     <p>In our trip to Melaka, one of the places we visted is the "A Famosa". The "A Famosa
                         " was a 16th century fortess built by the Portugese when they occupied Melaku. The photos
                        I took depicted the top-front of the "Porta de Santiago", which is a small gate house and
                        the other photo is the inside of the reminants of a Portuguese Church.
